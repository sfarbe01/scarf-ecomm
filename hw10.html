    <h1>Strategies for improving the load time of websites</h1>
    <p>When it comes to building a website, you have to start by asking two questions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Who are the people coming to my site?</li>
            <li>Why are these people coming to my site.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Answering these two questions will allow you to build an experience that appeals to your target demographics and makes people more likely to convert once they end up on your page. And speaking of conversions, one of the biggest reasons for people to abandon a page is a slow load time. You’ve worked too hard on your website to have someone leave because of a slow load time. Here are a few tips and tricks to keep your consumers happy and your load times swift.</p>
    <h3>1. Reduce HTTP requests</h3>
        <p>An HTTP request is made each time your site is trying to call an element. The more images, stylesheets and scripts your code is running, the slower your page will be to respond. In this case, simple design is your friend, and designing as much of your site in the CSS (as opposed to lots of fancy images) is ideal. That brings us to our second tip: optimize images.</p>
    <h3>2. Optimize images</h3>
        <p>Of course there will be times when you need to include images on your website. Always specify height and weight of your images, but more importantly, try to create images in the size you want them to be served. For example, if you have a square that is 1500px x 1500px, this file is likely much larger than what you need. If you want the square to appear with the dimension 500px x 500px, don’t simply specify this in the CSS. Create a new file that is 500px x 500px and cut your browser a break.</p>
    <h3>3. Use modern and valid code</h3>
        <p>As coding languages evolve, it’s important to make sure you are up to date with best practices. There are a lot of resources to check/validate your code to make sure you are not repeating unnecessary code or serving up code that the browser will have to fix. https://validator.w3.org/check is a great tool for verifying your code.</p>
    <h3>4. Minimize plug-ins</h3>
        <p>Everytime you install a new plug-in for your site, you're essentially setting up another js or CSS file that the browser will have to parse and serve up to users. Plug-ins can be super helpful to improving the experience of your website, but make sure you are only choosing the ones that are most important.</p>
    <h3>5. Some notes to keep in mind </h3>
        <p>Ideal page load speed is between 0 and 4 seconds. Anything slower than that will begin to dramatically impact things like bounce rate, session length, and ultimately conversion rates will plummet. Forrester reported that consumers expect a page to load in two seconds or less. This may seem unattainably slow, but just remember there are likely tens if not hundreds of other websites offering the same services as yours. To keep customers happy and keep them on your page, keep things moving quickly.</p>
